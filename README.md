# titanic-survival-predict

## Introduction
The sinking of Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, killing 1502 passengers out of 2224. The aim of this project is predicting what sorts of people were likely to survive?

There are 12 features totaly including TicketClass, Sex, Age, Number of siblings, Number of parents etc.

The dataset contains 1000 pieces of Data. And this project implemented cross validation to get the accuracy of 87%.

## Activities
● Dataset Overview

● Exploratory Data Analysis: Analysis of features and find trends/relations considering multiple features

● Feature Engineering: Remove redundant features and create new features

●  Predictive Modeling: Build up kNN, AdaBoost, and SVM predicitve models, improve the performance through cross-validation, tuning hyperparameters
